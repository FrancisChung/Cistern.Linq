# Cistern.Linq - it's part of the plumbing!

A 100% compatible, drop in replacement for Linq-to-Objects that is, mostly, faster!

In my spare time I have been working on this project for a number of years, originally as a replacement for
[F#'s Seq](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/2745), and more recently as a placement for
[System.Linq](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/34208). 

So although I have tried to get those PRs mainlined, understandably the project owners have balked at the
implied risk associated with such a venture. (And really this is just a spare time thing for me so I haven't
had the time to keep pushing...)
